1. Sync these files to <path>. For the rest of these instructions, we will
   assume $HOME/bin/public, but you may choose an arbirary location.
2. Use the *template files to modify the . files (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.)
   in your $HOME. Make sure to define $BIN_PUBLIC_ROOT to match <path> above.
3. Create a symlink from $HOME/bin/public/local to the appropriate OS directory
   under $HOME/bin/public.
4. To debug execution, define $DEBUG_BASH in your .bash_profile.
