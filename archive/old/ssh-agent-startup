# This script is intended to be source'd, not executed directly, so
# that is can set environment variables for the current shell.

# This is a script to allow one instance of ssh-agent to be used across
# multiple shells.  If ssh-agent is not already running on the current host,
# the script starts it, add the relevant credentials, and writes the values of
# SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK to a file in the SSH_AGENT_STARTUP_DIR
# directory. One file is created for each host. If the agent is already
# running, this script just sources the file for this host in order to set the
# same values for SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK to the appropriate values.
# Once those environment variables are set, the shell knows where to find the
# already running instance of ssh-agent.
